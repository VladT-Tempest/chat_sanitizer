## Sanitizing customer chat conversations with OpenAI API

** scenary **

In this project we try to solve a client request who is receiving hundreds of customer support chats on a daily basis. The script should sanitize these conversations and to warn which of them require additional attention.

The script will make these text conversations more accessible for further processing by CSD -customer support department- in those ways:

- convert date-time information to only show the date
- Remove rude words
- Remove personal identifiable info.
- Mark the conversation as "positive" or "negative"
